 ## Description
        When a user inputs a city they will get the current weather and 5 day forecast using api routes 

        
          - I built this project to gain a basic understanding of api's and fetching data through api's along with getting to create a weather app 


          - I learned how to use insomnia and how to fetch data and use insomnia to view the fetched data which i can then tap into and create objects
